- Verify at YAML load time that duplicated resources key are not present. To avoid overlapping of resources. https://gist.github.com/pypt/94d747fe5180851196eb
  Seems difficult as it does not support the safe_loader and use that loader is important to avoid loading malicious yaml serialized object.
  So a reviewer should take care to the the duplicated key issue and also look at the for not expected detected changes.
  Need to warn about that in the log
- Add a primary key mechanism to avoid duplicate resources (eg: project with same namespace and name)
- Add the repository object
